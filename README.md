# BetterBanner_2022
This is web application based in Ruby on Rails that I created for my Web Application class Fall of 2022.  The purpose of this application is to provide university adminstration access to student (i.e., name, stuent number, contact info,course registration, and class schedule) and academic (i.e., course details and student records) info.

Ruby 3.1.2p20
Rails (rake) 13.0.6

Necessary Gems (Both should already be in GemFile): ffi (Windows -> Testing), faker (generate "fake" data)

Application Installation:
Ensure the Ruby and Rails versions are the same as above or better
Download app directory either through a zip file or through git cloning
From terminal (in iOS, Linux) or command line (in Windows), then: 
navigate in to the directory currently housing the app
and then run "rails server" command 
Open local browser (Firefox was used on origin machine)
Navigate to the localhost http://127.0.0.1:3000
